# Cat Fishing Minigame WIP
My very first pygame game.    
Press and hold spacebar to power up the power bar, let go to throw the fishing pole.  (done!)
Wait for a bite, and then reel in the fish (or other items in the lake)!   (not implemented yet)
Press 1, 2, 3 to change the color of the cat. (done!)

## Day 10:

Made the throwing animation for the white cat only. 
Need to make fishing pole sprites that connect to the bobber after the throw.

## Day 9:
<img src = "https://i.imgur.com/8SZVEGr.gif">    
Rearranged some of the code so that it makes a little more sense when you read it.   
The bobber now moves according to how far the cat throws the bobber.   
The game is now "playable"! You can now catch 3 types of fish. They have slightly different spawn rates depending on how far you throw the bobber.  
The type of fish you caught and the number of points they're worth are printed in the terminal.  

## Day 8:
<img src = "https://i.imgur.com/iTG2LXZ.gif">
Made the power bar prettier. Changed the look of the cat slightly. Added the bobber and the fishing pole.
Game still not playable.

## Week 1:
<img src = "https://i.imgur.com/ohuYRB0.gif">
Game isn't done and it's not playable yet, but I've made the cat sprites, a portion of the instructions of the game in animated form in the top left hand corner, and the power bar for the fishing pole that I'm currently working on.
