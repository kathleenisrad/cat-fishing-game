# Cat Fishing Minigame
My very first pygame game.   
Press and hold spacebar to power up the power bar, let go to throw the fishing pole.  
Wait for a bite, and then reel in the fish (or other items in the lake)!   
Press 1, 2, 3 to change the color of the cat.

## WIP v1:

Game isn't done and it's not playable yet, but I've made the cat sprites, a portion of the instructions of the game in animated form in the top left hand corner, and the power bar for the fishing pole that I'm currently working on.
