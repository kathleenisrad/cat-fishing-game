# Cat Fishing Minigame
My very first pygame game.   
Press and hold spacebar to power up the power bar, let go to throw the fishing pole.  
Wait for a bite, and then reel in the fish (or other items in the lake)!   
Press 1, 2, 3 to change the color of the cat.

Made the power bar prettier. Changed the look of the cat slightly. Added the bobber and the fishing pole.
Game still not playable.

Game isn't done and it's not playable yet, but I've made the cat sprites, a portion of the instructions of the game in animated form in the top left hand corner, and the power bar for the fishing pole that I'm currently working on.
